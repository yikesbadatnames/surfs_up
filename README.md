# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview of Analysis
* <p> The purpose of this analysis was to get descriptive statistics tempatures in Hawaii for a surf and ice cream shop </p>

## Results
![June_Table](resources/June_Temp.png)

![Dec_Table](resources/Dec_Temp.png)

* <p> Here we can see that in June and December, there aren't huge differences in tempature. </p>

* <p> However, we can see that in June and Dec there is a significant difference in the quartiles. So while the means are similar the day to day weather does appear to be colder in December. </p>

* <p> Additionally, the STD of Dec is higher than in June, so that means there is greater variability in the weather. 


## Summary

*<p> June is warmer than December but not by much. It should not affect business as much as say. More insteresting data would probably be the tourism.
